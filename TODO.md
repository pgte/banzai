# To do

* Play (restart from current state)
* Promise using hook.io to get the events on a certain document:
  * When it
* JSON interface
* Web interface (another repo?)
* Be able to, on a worker, to flush all work and stop accepting new work. This can be useful for deployment rollouts.
* Build banzai-cqs (couchdb queueing)
* Verbose logging should be scoped to stateDoc.doc_id like this: "\[pipeline_name] [#doc_id]"
